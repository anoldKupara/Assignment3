# Assignment3

1. Write a Python function named classify_number that takes an integer as input and returns: "Positive" if the number is greater than zero. "Negative" if the number is less than zero. "Zero" if the number is zero. Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for a number until they enter a valid integer.
2. Define a Python function calculate_average that accepts a variable number of arguments (using *args) and returns the average of those numbers. Include appropriate documentation for the function using a docstring.          
3. Write a program that handles user input for a number. Use a try block to catch any ValueError exceptions that may occur if the user inputs an invalid number. Print an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid number again.                                   
4. Create a Python script that writes a list of names to a file called names.txt. Each name should be on a new line. Then, read the file and print each name to the console. Use the with statement to handle file operations and ensure the file is properly closed.         
5. Write a Python program that uses a lambda function and the map function to convert a list of temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula for conversion is F = C * 9/5 + 32. Include a sample list of Celsius temperatures and print the converted list.       
6. Create a function called divide_numbers that takes two parameters, numerator and denominator. Use a try block to handle: Division by zero (ZeroDivisionError). Invalid input types (TypeError). The function should return the result of the division if successful, and print an appropriate error message for each exception.                                                                           
7. Define a custom exception class called NegativeNumberError that inherits from the built-in Exception class. Write a function check_positive that raises this exception if a given number is negative. Demonstrate the use of this function in a try block.                                           
8. Write a Python program that uses the random module to generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100. Then, calculate and print the average of the generated numbers. Use appropriate functions to achieve this.                                                         
9. Write a program that: 
I. Uses regular expressions to extract all email addresses from a given text. 
II. Uses regular expressions to validate a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".                 
III. Uses regular expressions to replace all occurrences of a word with another word in a string. 
IV. Use regular expressions to split a string by all non-alphanumeric characters.      
10. Write a simple client-server program: 
The server should listen for incoming connections and send a message "Hello from server!". 
The client should connect to the server and receive the message. 
Include basic error handling for network operations.
